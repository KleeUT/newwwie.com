      "description": "The Women and Gender Diverse People in Tech is continuing our speaker series in May! This month we are excited to hear from Sarah Frazer!\n\nSarah Frazer is the Operations Manager at NewyTechPeople, and an all-around nerd. Sarah is passionate about pulling apart complex topics and making them more intuitive to the general public. She is one of the founders of the Women and Gender Diverse People in Technology group and focuses on supporting and uplifting women and gender-diverse people in the technology industry.\n\nIn this talk, Sarah will attempt to explain why she thinks your brain is \\*kinda\\* like a machine learning model, and why that's probably a good thing. This presentation will cover a crash course in some data concepts, while also dealing with bigger themes such as getting into technology as a career, finding workplaces that bring joy and tackling gender inequality in everyday life.\n\nEveryone is welcome to this event, no matter your gender- so share it with all of your friends. Through these speaker events, we aim to share experiences and knowledge, that's how we learn, and that's how we can improve the community for everyone.\n\n* **5:30PM:** The event starts with a catch-up\n* **6:00PM:** The presentation will begin\n\nFor this event we'll be gathering at the NewyTechPeople office in their event space at 24 Lindus Street, Wickham.\n\nThere will be pizza and refreshments provided, please let Arden or Sarah know of any dietaries you have beforehand.",
