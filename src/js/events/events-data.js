      "title": "July: Matt Goldman",
      "description": "Howdy Coders, We'll be back on the first Wednesday in July.\n\nWe'll have dinner provided and plenty of drinks. Provided by our sponsors, SSW and Saphi Engineering.\n\nWe'll be hosted by SSW Newcastle. The closest public transport is the Civic light rail stop. There is off-street parking available near the Museum.\n\n**Matt Goldman** from SSW will be travelling up from Sydney to give us an overview of passwordless authentication.\nBio: [https://www.ssw.com.au/people/matt-goldman](https://www.ssw.com.au/people/matt-goldman)\n\n**Beyond Passwords: The future (and present) of authentication**\n\nWe all know passwords are not fit for purpose, and we're slowly making our way to a \"post-password\" world. Passwords are a problem for security, convenience, and accessibility, and the future of authentication won't involve passwords at all.\n\nThere are already many options available to take passwords out of the picture for your authentication scenarios. We're all used to our phones and computers letting us login with our faces or fingers, and organisations like the FIDO alliance are building the foundations of the password-free future.\n\nBy using existing and well-established technologies, we can provide secure, convenient, passwordless authentication for our users. In fact, in many cases, a password is the worst possible option. Not every interaction has a keyboard or biometric sensor available, and many don't even involve a user at all.\n\nIn this talk, Matt Goldman gives us a glimpse of the future, showing how developers can use familiar technologies to minimise, or even eradicate, the use of passwords, paving the way for safe, secure, and seamless authentication using the technology already in our hands.",

      "title": "CSIRO's Embedded Intelligence Platform ",
      "description": "**About the Topic:**\nJoin us for our upcoming event on Thursday, July 6th, where we'll be delving into CSIRO's Embedded Intelligence Platform!\n\nThe Embedded Intelligence Platform (EIP) is an IoT Platform-as-a-Service that can be used to rapidly develop low-power, untethered IoT solutions with rich functionality.\n\nEIP is already been utilised for a number of commercial and research applications, each leveraging many features of the platform to rapidly deliver next-gen IoT functionality in complex use cases. EIP works with the Zephyr Project RTOS and offers features such as device-to-device encrypted communications, delay-tolerant data downloading, fast over-the-air updates, multi-hop multi-technology non-IP communications such as relaying via BLE to a device and then forwarding over LoRaWAN.\n\nThe platform is also designed to allow high reconfigurability of applications, eliminating the need for firmware updates for many situations. The technology is currently being spun out of CSIRO, and we're keen to engage entities looking to create next-gen IoT solutions at scale.\n\n**About the Speaker:**\nDr Philip Valencia is the Embedded Intelligence Team Leader at CSIRO’s Data61 Cyber-Physical Systems Program, Brisbane, Australia. Phil has 20 years of experience in generating IoT and ultra-low power wireless solutions for “embedding intelligence” into applications across digital agriculture, ecology, logistics, construction, manufacturing, smart sites, human and pet health and more.\n\nHe holds several patents, coauthored 50+ peer-reviewed publications and is a recipient of the CSIRO Julius Career Award (2020) and CSIRO Entrepreneurship Award (2019). Phil leads a team that has captured deep tech engineering capabilities into a supported IoT Platform-as-a-Service known as the Embedded Intelligence Platform (EIP) to enable companies to rapidly create low-power, untethered, IoT solutions and get them to market fast\n\nIt's an event you won't want to miss! As always, there will be plenty of time for questions and networking. And, of course, we'll supply catering, so be sure to get in quickly!\n\nRSVP now to secure your spot!",

      "description": "The Women and Gender Diverse People in Tech is continuing our speaker series in June! This month, our speaker is Annie Chayko!\n\nAnnie will be discussing ‘Imposter Syndrome’ and reflecting on the importance of diversity in engineering and tech touching on her career experiences . Her career began as a marine engineering officer working on-board international cruise ships, including the famous Cunard transatlantic liner RMS Queen Mary 2. She has travelled around the globe working with international crews, predominantly as the only female in the large engineering department. She has since transitioned to shore-side, holding various engineering roles supporting the Royal Australian Navy. Annie is currently Engineering Services Manager based at Thales, Carrington.\n\nEveryone is welcome to this event, no matter your gender- so share it with all of your friends. Through these speaker events, we aim to share experiences and knowledge, that's how we learn, and that's how we can improve the community for everyone.\n\n**5:30PM:** The event starts with a catch-up\n**6:00PM:** The presentation will begin\n\nFor this event we'll be gathering at the NewyTechPeople office in their event space at 24 Lindus Street, Wickham.\n\nThere will be pizza and refreshments provided, please let Arden or Sarah know of any dietaries you have beforehand.",
