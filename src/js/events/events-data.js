      "description": "The Women and Gender Diverse People in Tech are continuing our speaker series in September! Our speaker this month is Jordan Freeman!\n\nJordan, a fervent advocate for the transformative potential of technology, will be presenting her insights drawn from a 10-year journey in the digital domain. As a Senior Project Manager and Senior Delivery Lead, she has steered a multitude of digital transformation projects ranging from ambitious undertakings for universities and national companies to large-scale multinational initiatives.\n\nThe focal point of her presentation, however, will be her personal journey living with an invisible disability. Jordan will share the unique challenges she faced within the corporate environment, shedding light on the intricate balance between accommodating her condition and excelling in her profession.\n\nJordan's passion for technology and her desire to address social issues has guided her towards her own startup venture, channelling the power of digital tools to carve pathways of social inclusion for people with disability.\n\nEveryone is welcome to this event, regardless of gender- so share it with your friends. Through these speaker events, we aim to share experiences and knowledge, that's how we learn, and that's how we can improve the community for everyone.\n\n**5:30PM:** The event starts with a catch-up\n\n**6:00PM:** The presentation will begin\n\nWe'll gather at the NewyTechPeople office at 24 Lindus Street, Wickham for this event.\n\nThere will be pizza and refreshments provided. Please let Arden or Sarah know of any dietaries you have beforehand.",
