There is no set agenda, you can arrive and leave when you please, and dinner and drinks are optional (but at your own expense).\n\nThe Honeysuckle Hotel is where we usually go after our events at the university's Q Building. There is no booking but we will try and gather some tables.\n\nIf you can't find us, call out in the [Newwwie Slack #data-science channel](https://newwwie.slack.com/archives/CBD021X0U) and we'll direct you.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nWhen: Thursday 19th of October 5.30pm-8.30pm\n\nWhere: The Honeysuckle Hotel, Honeysuckle Drive, Newcastle",
