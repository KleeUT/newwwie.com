The strategies Leanora has developed over her product management carrer have resulted in her winning 2 global communication awards.\n\nWhilst this talk is aimed at a developers, you take these insights with you in any stakeholder situation.\n\nThis talk will be one that you'll be able to walk away with ideas that you can implement immediately.\n\n**Agenda:**\n6:00 pm - Door open, pizza and drinks\n6:30 pm - Intro and tech news\n6:45 pm - Leanora Horne - 404 to Fluent\n7:30 pm - Drinks and discussions\n\n#software #coders #developers #productmanagement #digital",
