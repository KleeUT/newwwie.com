      "description": "Hello friends! Welcome back to NCSG for 2023. This month, we've got J talking about Docker vs MicroVMs and exploring the security boundaries and assumptions we make about them.\n\nJ is a home-lab enthusiast in their downtime and threat management & incident response lead in their professional life. They love being challenged by all manner of cybersecurity problems, will remind you how their choice of operating system is just better than yours and that if it's not declared as code you'll make everyone a sad panda.\n\n**Synopsis**\n\nThe last decade of development lifecycle has been enabled by the rise of Docker and containerised workloads. In this talk, we'll explore the assumptions that may be made from a security control perspective when utilising containers in comparison to MicroVMs.\n\nThis talk is aimed at a hobbyist to early professional level but does not expect you to understand deep technical concepts - the talk is intended to be interactive where possible and attendees are invited to interrupt frequently with questions**.**\n\n**Event details:**\n\nDate: **WEDNESDAY** June 28th - **We're doing Wednesdays now!**\n\nTime: 18:00-20:00\n\nVenue: 16 Honeysuckle Drive, Newcastle (The University of Newcastle 'Q Building') - bottom floor (**no longer upstairs!**)\n\nFood: PIZZAS Provided, please inform us of dietary requirements when RSVPing\n\nDrink: Non-alcoholic provided, come and grab a few with us at the pub after if you'd like!\n\n**Getting there/parking/public transport:**\n\n* Event location is [here](https://goo.gl/maps/rCqoDx8MbjqyeHTMA) \\- please use the western door\\. UoN requires us to keep this door closed for safety\\, so there will be someone there to let you in\\.\n* Please try and get in the door before 6:10pm. We check occasionally but you might get stuck outside in the cold for a while.\n* The [car park behind the building](https://goo.gl/maps/FzNNQfbAxxW38GNr7) is free after 5PM, and generally has plenty of room.\n* The closest public transport point is [Honeysuckle Light Rail Station](https://goo.gl/maps/3P2BpkiMaCeZ8isk9), which will take you to Newcastle Interchange and beyond every \\~7min or so. Walk along Honeysuckle Drive for a better-lit pathway.\n\n**The rest:**\n\nIf you’re experiencing any symptoms representative of COVID-19, please don’t attend. We’ll miss you, but the health/safety of attendees is paramount.\n\nNCSG is a community group determined to improve and uplift the Newcastle cybersecurity community. We meet monthly (on the last Wednesday of each month) and have a bunch of interesting speakers, from local legends to heavy hitters in the enterprise world.\n\n**Want to learn more?** Be sure to follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/newcastlecybersecuritygroup/) or visit newwwie.com, join the community and come and chat in the #security channel.\n\n**Keen on organising or speaking?

      "description": "We'll have two speakers for our July meeting;\n**Matt Goldman** from SSW will be travelling up from Sydney to give us an overview of passwordless authentication.\n\n**Paul Usher** from DevExpress will be flying down from Brisbane to give a talk on an as-yet-to-be-decided topic.\nBoth of these speakers are great speakers who have spoken at events and conferences worldwide.\n\nWe'll be hosted and sponsored by SSW Newcastle.\n\n**Talk 1: Beyond Passwords: The future (and present) of authentication**\n\nWe all know passwords are not fit for purpose, and we're slowly making our way to a \"post-password\" world. Passwords are a problem for security, convenience, and accessibility, and the future of authentication won't involve passwords at all.\n\nThere are already many options available to take passwords out of the picture for your authentication scenarios. We're all used to our phones and computers letting us login with our faces or fingers, and organisations like the FIDO alliance are building the foundations of the password-free future.\n\nBy using existing and well-established technologies, we can provide secure, convenient, passwordless authentication for our users. In fact, in many cases, a password is the worst possible option. Not every interaction has a keyboard or biometric sensor available, and many don't even involve a user at all.\n\nIn this talk, Matt Goldman gives us a glimpse of the future, showing how developers can use familiar technologies to minimise, or even eradicate, the use of passwords, paving the way for safe, secure, and seamless authentication using the technology already in our hands.\n\nBio: [https://www.ssw.com.au/people/matt-goldman](https://www.ssw.com.au/people/matt-goldman)\n\n**Talk 2:**",

      "title": "CSIRO's Embedded Intelligence Platform ",
      "description": "**About the Topic:**\nJoin us for our upcoming event on Thursday, July 6th, where we'll be delving into CSIRO's Embedded Intelligence Platform!\n\nThe Embedded Intelligence Platform (EIP) is an IoT Platform-as-a-Service that can be used to rapidly develop low-power, untethered IoT solutions with rich functionality.\n\nEIP is already been utilised for a number of commercial and research applications, each leveraging many features of the platform to rapidly deliver next-gen IoT functionality in complex use cases. EIP works with the Zephyr Project RTOS and offers features such as device-to-device encrypted communications, delay-tolerant data downloading, fast over-the-air updates, multi-hop multi-technology non-IP communications such as relaying via BLE to a device and then forwarding over LoRaWAN.\n\nThe platform is also designed to allow high reconfigurability of applications, eliminating the need for firmware updates for many situations. The technology is currently being spun out of CSIRO, and we're keen to engage entities looking to create next-gen IoT solutions at scale.\n\n**About the Speaker:**\nDr Philip Valencia is the Embedded Intelligence Team Leader at CSIRO’s Data61 Cyber-Physical Systems Program, Brisbane, Australia. Phil has 20 years of experience in generating IoT and ultra-low power wireless solutions for “embedding intelligence” into applications across digital agriculture, ecology, logistics, construction, manufacturing, smart sites, human and pet health and more.\n\nHe holds several patents, coauthored 50+ peer-reviewed publications and is a recipient of the CSIRO Julius Career Award (2020) and CSIRO Entrepreneurship Award (2019). Phil leads a team that has captured deep tech engineering capabilities into a supported IoT Platform-as-a-Service known as the Embedded Intelligence Platform (EIP) to enable companies to rapidly create low-power, untethered, IoT solutions and get them to market fast\n\nIt's an event you won't want to miss! As always, there will be plenty of time for questions and networking. And, of course, we'll supply catering, so be sure to get in quickly!\n\nRSVP now to secure your spot!",
