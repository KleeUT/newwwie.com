      "title": "NCSG April 2024 | Supercharging Engagement with AusCERT",
      "description": "Hi all!\n\nTHis month we have Shannon Hartley returning to talk about how CEnet supercharged their engagement with AusCERT;\n\nWhen, with AusCERT, you register more than a thousand top level domains and the number of IP addresses is a number you don't know how to say, well, the notifications can become quite the time-consuming job.\n\nSee how CEnet moved from manual-handling of email notifications to having them automatically received, parsed, collated into reports and paid-forward to a national network of Catholic education organisations.\n\nDiscover how encrypted attachments in SIAs can be handled automatically, and how keeping track of notification history can produce insights for more user-friendly reports for your communities.\n\nCEnet supports open security collaboration, so this session offers a transparent and practical view on what we have built - free for others to take and make their own.\n\nQuestions, discussions and feedback of ideas will be encouraged.\n\nWhat audience gains:\n\n* How to structure a database to track notifications and drive automation\n* Walkthrough of the logic behind automation workflows for SIAs and MSINs\n* See actual samples of enriched reports produced from raw notifications\n* Help realise time savings from automation and inspire new ideas for other uses\n* Stimulates requirements for new and upcoming AusCERT offerings such as CTIS and API.\n\n**Event details:**\n\nDate: **WEDNESDAY** April 24th\n\nTime: 18:00-20:00\n\nVenue: 16 Honeysuckle Drive, Newcastle (The University of Newcastle 'Q Building') - second floor\n\nFood: PIZZAS Provided, please inform us of dietary requirements when RSVPing\n\nDrink: Non-alcoholic provided, come and grab a few with us at the pub after if you'd like!\n\n**Getting there/parking/public transport:**\n\n* Event location is [here](https://goo.gl/maps/rCqoDx8MbjqyeHTMA) \\- please use the western door\\. UoN requires us to keep this door closed for safety\\, so there will be someone there to let you in\\.\n* Please try and get in the door before 6:10pm. We check occasionally but you might get stuck outside in the cold for a while.\n* The [car park behind the building](https://goo.gl/maps/FzNNQfbAxxW38GNr7) is free after 5PM, and generally has plenty of room.\n* The closest public transport point is [Honeysuckle Light Rail Station](https://goo.gl/maps/3P2BpkiMaCeZ8isk9), which will take you to Newcastle Interchange and beyond every \\~7min or so. Walk along Honeysuckle Drive for a better-lit pathway.\n\n**The rest:**\n\nIf you’re experiencing any symptoms representative of COVID-19, please don’t attend. We’ll miss you, but the health/safety of attendees is paramount.\n\nNCSG is a community group determined to improve and uplift the Newcastle cybersecurity community. We meet monthly (on the last Wednesday of each month) and have a bunch of interesting speakers, from local legends to heavy hitters in the enterprise world.\n\n**Want to learn more?** Be sure to follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/newcastlecybersecuritygroup/) or visit newwwie.com, join the community and come and chat in the #security channel.\n\n**Keen on speaking?
