      "description": "We're skipping the talk in October and heading straight to the pub, so feel free to join us on Thursday 19th October from 5:30pm as we have a casual get together.\n\nIt's a great opportunity for networking, especially for those who usually can't make it after the talks each month. There is no set agenda, you can arrive and leave when you please, and dinner and drinks are optional (but at your own expense).\n\nThe Honeysuckle Hotel is where we usually go after our events at the university's Q Building. There is no booking but we will try and gather some tables.\n\nIf you can't find us, call out in the [Newwwie Slack #data-science channel](https://newwwie.slack.com/archives/CBD021X0U) and we'll direct you.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nWhen: Thursday 19th of October 5.30pm-8.30pm\n\nWhere: The Honeysuckle Hotel, Honeysuckle Drive, Newcastle",
