      "description": "We're back for our first meeting of 2024, with [Leanora Horne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leanorahorne/) speaking about her award winning communication strategies for developers.\n\nIn this talk, Leanora will share strategies for creating genuine stakeholder relationships to drive the best product development outcomes. The strategies Lenora has developed over her product management carrer have resulted in her winning 2 global communication awards.\n\nThis talk is super important for anyone who wants to progress into senior roles in software development. The biggest difference between junior developers and senior, principal and staff developers is not the amount of code they can write; it's how they communicate with their teams and stakeholders to ensure that they're aligned and building the right thing.\nThis talk will be one that you'll be able to walk away with ideas that you can implement immediately.\n\n**Agenda:**\n6:00 pm - Door open, pizza and drinks\n6:30 pm - Intro and tech news\n6:45 pm - Leanora Horne - 404 to Fluent\n7:30 pm - Drinks and discussions",
